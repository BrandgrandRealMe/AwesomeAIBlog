Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the world in many ways, from enhancing productivity and efficiency to enabling new forms of creativity and innovation. However, not everyone has access to the latest and greatest AI technologies, especially if they are proprietary and expensive. That’s why open source AI is so important and valuable. Open source AI is AI that is publicly available for anyone to use, modify, and share under various open source licenses. Open source AI can include datasets, algorithms, and user interfaces that can help you create your own AI applications or improve existing ones. In this blog post, we will introduce you to the top 5 awesome FOSS (free and open source software) AI tools and websites that you can use for your personal or professional projects. These tools and websites cover various domains and tasks, such as natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, and more. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, you will find something useful and interesting in this list.


## 1. TensorFlow
TensorFlow is one of the most popular and widely used open source AI frameworks in the world. It was developed by Google and is designed to enable fast and flexible experimentation with deep learning models. TensorFlow supports multiple languages, platforms, and devices, and offers a rich set of tools and libraries for data processing, visualization, debugging, and deployment. TensorFlow also has a large and active community of developers and researchers who contribute to its development and improvement. You can use TensorFlow to build and train various types of neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and more. TensorFlow also supports distributed training and inference, which can help you scale up your AI applications to handle large amounts of data and computation. You can install TensorFlow on Linux using pip, conda, or docker, and get started with its tutorials and documentation[^1].


## 3. OpenCV
OpenCV is the leading open source library for computer vision and image processing. It was founded in 1999 by Intel and is now supported by a global community of developers and researchers. OpenCV provides more than 2500 optimized algorithms for various tasks, such as face detection, object recognition, segmentation, tracking, feature extraction, calibration, and more. OpenCV also supports machine learning and deep learning models, such as SVM, KNN, CNN, and DNN. OpenCV is compatible with multiple languages, platforms, and devices, and offers a high-level interface for Python, Java, and MATLAB. OpenCV also has a low-level interface for C and C++, which allows you to access the core functionality and performance of the library. You can use OpenCV to build and deploy various types of computer vision and image processing applications, such as face recognition, augmented reality, video surveillance, medical imaging, and more. You can install OpenCV on Linux using pip, conda, or cmake, and get started with its tutorials and documentation[^2].


## 4. ChatGPT
ChatGPT is an open source AI conversation platform that uses a large language model (LLM) to generate natural and engaging dialogues. ChatGPT is based on GPT-3, one of the most advanced and powerful LLMs in the world, developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT allows you to chat with various personas, such as celebrities, fictional characters, historical figures, and more. You can also create your own custom personas and chatbots using ChatGPT’s easy and intuitive interface. ChatGPT is designed to be safe and reliable, and uses various techniques to prevent harmful or misleading outputs. ChatGPT is compatible with multiple platforms, such as web, mobile, and desktop, and supports multiple languages, such as English, French, German, and more. ChatGPT also has a large and active community of users and contributors who provide helpful feedback and support. You can use ChatGPT to have fun, learn, and explore the possibilities of AI-powered conversations. You can access ChatGPT for free on its website, or upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for more features and benefits.


## 5. Hugging Face
Hugging Face is an open source AI company that provides a platform for natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG). Hugging Face is best known for its Transformers library, which offers easy access to hundreds of pre-trained models for various NLP and NLG tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, text summarization, text generation, and more. Hugging Face also provides tools and services for building, sharing, and deploying your own custom models, such as Datasets, Tokenizers, Spaces, and Inference API. Hugging Face is compatible with Python and supports multiple frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX. Hugging Face also has a large and active community of users and contributors who provide helpful resources and support. You can use Hugging Face to build and deploy various types of NLP and NLG applications, such as chatbots, content creation, knowledge extraction, and more. You can install Hugging Face on Linux using pip or conda, and get started with its tutorials and documentation.
