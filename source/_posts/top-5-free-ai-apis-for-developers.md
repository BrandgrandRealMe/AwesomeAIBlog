Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting and powerful technologies of our time. It can help us solve complex problems, automate tasks, and create new possibilities for innovation. However, building AI applications can be challenging and costly, especially for developers who lack the expertise or resources to implement AI solutions from scratch.

Fortunately, there are many AI APIs available that provide access to advanced AI features and algorithms through simple and easy-to-use interfaces. These APIs allow developers to integrate AI capabilities into their applications without having to worry about the underlying details or infrastructure. Whether you want to add natural language processing, image recognition, text-to-speech, or any other AI functionality to your app, there is an API for that.

In this blog post, we will introduce you to the top 5 free AI APIs that you can use to enhance your applications with AI. These APIs are:

- Qloo
- Amazon Polly
- Cortex
- Cloudlabs Text To Speech
- Text To Speech Neural/Google

Let’s take a closer look at each of these APIs and see what they can do for you.


## Qloo
Qloo is the “Cultural AI”, decoding and predicting consumer taste across the globe. It is a privacy-first API that predicts global consumer preferences and catalogs hundreds of millions of cultural entities. Through its API, it provides contextualized personalization and insights based on a deep understanding of consumer behavior and more than 575 million people, places, and things[^1].

Qloo’s API allows you to look up entities in its vast library spanning categories like brands, music, film, fashion, travel destinations, and notable people. You can also get recommendations based on demographics, preferences, cultural entities, metadata, and geolocational factors. Qloo’s API is used by companies who want to incorporate best-in-class data in their consumer experiences[^1].

Qloo’s API is free to use and has a generous quota of 10,000 requests per month. You can sign up for an API key on its website and start using it right away.


## Amazon Polly
Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create applications that talk, and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. Polly’s Text-to-Speech (TTS) service uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize natural sounding human speech. With dozens of lifelike voices across a broad set of languages, you can build speech-enabled applications that work in many different countries[^2].

Amazon Polly also offers Neural Text-to-Speech (NTTS) voices that deliver advanced improvements in speech quality through a new machine learning approach. Polly’s Neural TTS technology also supports two speaking styles that allow you to better match the delivery style of the speaker to the application: a Newscaster reading style that is tailored to news narration use cases, and a Conversational speaking style that is ideal for two-way communication like telephony applications[^2].

Amazon Polly is free to use for up to 5 million characters per month for the first 12 months. After that, you pay a low price per character based on the type of voice and the amount of speech you generate. You can get started with Amazon Polly by creating an AWS account and using the AWS SDK or the AWS CLI to access the service.


## Cortex
Cortex is a platform that enables developers to deploy, manage, and scale machine learning models in production. Cortex provides an API-based infrastructure that handles everything from data ingestion, model serving, monitoring, and versioning. With Cortex, you can deploy any kind of machine learning model, whether it is built with TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, or any other framework[^3].

Cortex’s API allows you to easily integrate your machine learning models with your applications, without having to write any boilerplate code or deal with complex configurations. You can also scale your models automatically based on the demand, and monitor their performance and health with real-time metrics and alerts. Cortex’s API is designed to be simple, fast, and reliable[^3].

Cortex is free to use for up to 10 models and 100 GB of data per month. You can install Cortex on any Kubernetes cluster, whether it is on AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-premises. You can also use Cortex’s CLI to deploy and manage your models from your terminal.


## Cloudlabs Text To Speech
Cloudlabs Text To Speech is an API that converts text to speech using state-of-the-art neural networks. It supports multiple languages and accents, and can generate high-quality audio files in various formats. You can use Cloudlabs Text To Speech to create voiceovers, audiobooks, podcasts, or any other audio content from text[^4].

Cloudlabs Text To Speech’s API is very easy to use. You just need to send a POST request with the text, language, and voice parameters, and you will receive a URL to download the audio file. You can also customize the speed, pitch, and volume of the speech, and add effects like echo, reverb, or distortion. Cloudlabs Text To Speech’s API is fast and reliable, and can handle large amounts of text[^4].

Cloudlabs Text To Speech is free to use for up to 1,000 requests per month. You can get an API key by registering on its website and start using it right away.


## Text To Speech Neural/Google
Text To Speech Neural/Google is an API that converts text to speech using Google’s WaveNet technology. WaveNet is a deep neural network that generates raw audio waveforms from text, resulting in natural and realistic speech. It supports multiple languages and voices, and can produce speech with various emotions and tones.

Text To Speech Neural/Google’s API is very simple to use. You just need to send a GET request with the text and voice parameters, and you will receive a base64-encoded audio file in the response. You can also specify the sample rate, encoding, and pitch of the speech, and add SSML tags to control the pronunciation, emphasis, and pauses. Text To Speech Neural/Google’s API is fast and accurate, and can generate speech with high fidelity.

Text To Speech Neural/Google is free to use for up to 500 requests per month. You can get an API key by signing up on RapidAPI and start using it right away.

These are the top 5 free AI APIs that we recommend for developers who want to add AI features to their applications. Of course, there are many more AI APIs out there, and you can explore them on RapidAPI, the world’s largest API marketplace. RapidAPI allows you to find, test, and connect to thousands of APIs, including AI APIs, with just a few clicks. You can also use RapidAPI to manage your API consumption, billing, and analytics from one dashboard.
